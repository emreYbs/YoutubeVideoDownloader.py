# YoutubeVideoDownloader.py
A simple CLI tool to download Youtube videos

**USAGE** : 
python3 YoutubeVideoDownloader.py 

**NOTES** :
Normally to download a Youtube video, few lines would be enough and 1-2 modeules to import but for learning purposes, I imported some modules which helped to use emojis, colors in the CLI tool, and the code is unnecessary long or not a clean code:). My aim was just to practise, but the code works well and pytube module works better for me than youtube-dl, faster and not many connection errors. So I can advise you to use the tool or edit freely as your needs.

- Read the comments in the screenshot. You can download one or more videos, but you need to edit the variable accordingly. It is a **list** for this necessity.
